Sorting Algorithms implementation

All 3 kinds of sorting are inherited from Sort_Algo base class.

Instructions:

1. Clone the project from Github using the link to your IDE (I used Clion)
2. Sort Algorithm object is represented in Sort_Algo.h and Sort_Algo.cpp.
3. Run main function:
    In the console the execution time in milliseconds of each sorting algorithm will be printed.
    3 output files will be added under data dir with the expected output.
